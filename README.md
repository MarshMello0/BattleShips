## Info
### How do I host a server and play
Just run the start server shortcut and the exe its self, then you will be able to join via Lan
### What IP/Port do I give to my friends to join
The IP is fetched from http://checkip.dyndns.org/ and the port is always 15937
But all you need to give is your IP
### People can't join my server
Make sure they haven't got any spaces in the IP address field, and make sure you the host have the port 15937 open
### Why can I spam the cannons
I didn't bother adding a cool down, thought it would make it harder.
### I got kicked to the main menu
Either you lost connection or the host closed the game down
### I've lost the players in the host screen!
Good Luck finding them! There is no way to teleport back to the spawn üòú
